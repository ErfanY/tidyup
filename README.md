# TidyUp

## Description
TidyUp is a file sorter script which sorts files based on the extension.

This script creates a directory for each file extension and moves the files with that extension to this directory.
For example if there are two files *foo1.txt* and *foo2.txt* a **txt** directory will be created and *foo1.txt* and *foo2.txt* will be moved to **txt** directory.
